# BostonRoadAccidents

Many drivers hate sharing the road with bicyclists, but perhaps they could become allies, if road improvements for bikes made the road safer for cars as well and vice versa. In this project, I am examining what road attributes predict a greater density of car accidents and bike accidents, in hopes of finding road qualities that could be changed to produce a lower accident density for both cars and bikes.

This project focuses on bike and car accidents in the greater Boston area.
